# SQL Challenges Project

## Project Overview

This project consists of a series of SQL challenges of varying complexity levels, each to be solved in its own file. The main goal is to enhance SQL skills by solving real-world data querying scenarios.

## Development
### Technologies
 - SQL

## Project Structure
The project is structured around multiple SQL files, each serving a specific function:
desafioN.sql: Each file contains the SQL code for the corresponding challenge, where N is the challenge number.

## Project Requirements

The project successfully meets the specified requirements from the bootcamp readme:
- **SQL Queries**: Creation of SQL queries to find the expected information for each challenge.
- **File Structure**: Each challenge is solved in its own file, named desafioN.sql, where N is the challenge number.
- **Code Annotations**
Each SQL file contains a single SQL query that solves the corresponding challenge. For example, the file desafio1.sql might contain a query like this:
```sql
SELECT product_name FROM products;
```
This query selects the names of all products from the products table.
